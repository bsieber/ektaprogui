Small program with graphical user interface to control one or more Ektapro slide projectors using serial interfaces. Supports manual slide changing, fading, brightness control and offers a timer mode using one or several projectors. Useful for quick slideshows and testing without the need of configuration or special setup, especially for the lower-end projectors (like 5020) which do not have a dedicated hardware controller.
